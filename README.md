Odin Foundations: Recipe

Current objective is to complete a basic website of recipe navigation links.
    
    
    Skills used on this website:
    - demonstrated my basic understanding of HTMl elements, organization
      and best practices.
     - worked with different heading elements in a descending order from greatest to <h4>.
     - implemented the use of anchor tags to navigate to other recipes
        from the 'Home' page.
     - using the <img> tag, I incorporated free images to add some substance
      to my web pages. Using supplemental learning resources, I was able to include
      size tags (width="percentage") within my <img> tags to keep my images responsive.
     - utilized unordered <ul> and ordered <ol> lists to itemize ingredients and outline 
      preparation steps, respectively. Noted that <br> tags at the end of a list item 
      result in a pleasant spacing between preparation steps.


    Skills that I had to look back on to refresh memory: 
     - I did have to look back at the Git Basics lesson to try to understand why my commit messages were not submitting properly. After staging and attempting to commit a message with a subject and body, VScode would open in preparation for my message. 
        I would type out my subject, skip down two lines and write my message. Upon saving and exiting, my commit would not show in my terminal or to Github after pushing. I may need to look into this further to figure out why it wasn't working.
    I ended up sticking with the command 'git commit -m' and typing a short message in the terminal to keep track of important work flow updates.
    - did not include lang="en" in my opening <HTML> tags, must commit to memory as this is 
    best practice.
